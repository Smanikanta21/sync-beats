  "description": "1. Project Title Sync Beats – A Cross-Platform Music Synchronization System 2. Problem Statement Existing music synchronization systems like Apple’s AirPlay are restricted to their ecosystems (Apple-only), which prevents seamless use across devices from different platforms. There is currently no universal system that allows synchronized playback of music across Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS devices. Sync Beats solves this by providing a platform-independent music synchronization system that ensures perfect playback alignment across all connected devices using network-based clock synchronization and drift correction. 3. System Architecture Architecture: Frontend → Backend (API) → Database Stack Overview: ●   Frontend: Next.js (React-based framework) with TailwindCSS ●   Backend: Node.js + Express.js (hosted on Vercel as serverless functions) ●   Database: PostgreSQL(prisma) via Neon.tech ●   Authentication: JWT-based authentication stored in HttpOnly cookies ●   Hosting:",
